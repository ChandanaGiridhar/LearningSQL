SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. It is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables

A Data Scientist needs SQL to handle structured data. As the structured data is stored in relational databases. 
As i am aspiring to be a data scientist, i am starting to learn SQL from basics that is the most fundamental CRUD operations.
